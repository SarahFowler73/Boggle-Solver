This project was built on top of my "Boggle in 4 Gours" game (https://github.com/SarahFowler73/Boggle), with approximately an additional hour of work. 

"Boggle in 4 Hours" was a rapidly-built project that alotted 4 hours from opening the prompt, which was to create a web-based boggle game, to delivery of the working url. An additional prompt to build a boggle board solver -- where the user could put their own letters into a board, and have the program solve for all viable words -- was a stretch goal, and that is what is included here. 

Because of this time constraint, there are some decisions that were made for expediency's sake, rather than in the interest of good design. Things I would have liked to do or improve include replacing inline styles with of CSS files, adding unit tests, improving organization and cleanliness of code, removing unneeded boilerplate, and making the game look more attractive with a better UI. In addition, there are things that would make the boggle solver itself better, such as supporting a "Qu" option, and sorting results by length and alphabetically.
